## Setup

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

To follow along the examples of this subject, here is what you need to do:

1. Create a new directory somewhere in your filesystem. Let's call it `rxjs`
1. Create those files in this new `rxjs` directory:
  - An `index.html` file with [minimal markup][htmlshell],
  - A blank `script.js`
3. Include the **RxJS library** and the `script.js` file in `index.html` before the `&lt;/body>` tag:
  ```html
  <body>
  * <script src="https://unpkg.com/rxjs@^7/dist/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js"></script>
  * <script src="./script.js"></script>
  &lt;/body>
  ```

> Note that we did not install RxJS using `npm` here, as that would require a lot more setup and configuration
> and that is not the purpose of this subject.

## What (the hell) is...

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

<h4>... an observable?</h4>

An observable is an **asynchronous data stream**, meaning that it emits **multiple events over time**.

For example, a user's **mouse clicks** on a website could easily be modeled as an observable:
there will be several of them and they will happen at different times in the future.

<h4>... reactive programming</h4>

Basically, **reactive programming** is programming with **asynchronous** data **streams** by reacting to their events.

<h4>... RxJS</h4>

**RxJS** stands for [**R**eactive**X**][rx] for **J**ava**S**cript, and is a JS library that provides an amazing toolbox of functions to **create, combine and filter** observables.

---
## Observing Observables

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

As said previously, an Observable is a stream of data. It can:

- **Emit different values** over time
- **Emit an error** event and stop
- **Complete** gracefully and stop

Many documentation explaining Observables and reactive programming do so by using **marble diagrams** to represent them graphically. Here's one that resumes the three properties above (using a "click" stream example):

<p class="center shadow"><img src="images/reactive-programming.png"></p>

---
## Simple illustration

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

Suppose you want to react to clicks on a particular button in your page:

```html
<body>
  <button id="myButton">Button</button>

  <!-- Scripts -->
&lt;/body>
```

This could be achieved in pure JavaScript by adding an `EventListener` to the `click` event of the button and providing a callback:

```js
document
  .getElementById("myButton")
  .addEventListener(
    "click",
    () => alert("Button has been clicked")
  );
```

---
### Work with Observables

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#6">Simple illustration</a>]

Let's convert this to reactive programming. Remove any previous code in `script.js` and add:

```js
const { fromEvent } = rxjs; // `1`

fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click") // `2`
  .subscribe(() => alert("Button has been clicked")); // `3`
```
**`1`** - The **RxJS** library is available through the `rxjs` global variable. We used some [destructuring assignment][destructuring] to only get the `fromEvent(...)` function.
> In a properly configured application, you would have accessed this function by `import`ing from the `rxjs` module

**`2`** - [`fromEvent(...)`][from-event] creates an `Observable` that will emit **each particular event** occuring on **a particular DOM element**. Here, those are `click` events on the `#myButton` element.

**`3`** - `Observable`s _usually_ won't **emit** any values until an **Observer subscribes to them** by calling their `subscribe(...)` method, passing it a callback which will be called by the `Observable` for each value it emits.

> Go on and click the button, now.

### Complicate all the things

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#6">Simple illustration</a>]

Suppose now, for the sake of the argument, that we want to react to the button being clicked only if the user also **pressed the `Shift` key** while clicking, in which case we display in an alert **the coordinates of the mouse**.

Without using **RxJS** and `Observables`, we could write something like this:

```js
document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  // Check if the event has been fired while the Shift key was pressed
* if (event.shiftKey) {
    // Extract the mouse coordinates from the MouseEvent object
*   const coordinates = {
*     x: event.pageX,
*     y: event.pageY
*   };
    // Display the coordinates in an alert string
*   alert(\`Clicked at [${coordinates.x}, ${coordinates.y}]`);
* }
});
```
At first glance, nothing prevents us to write **the exact same code** in an `Observable`'s `subscribe` callback and  go on our merry way.

> That would work, but **RxJS** allows you to be more structured..

#### The RxJs way!

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#6">Simple illustration</a> > <a href="#8">Complicate all the things</a>]

Here is how you would write this feature, following the **RxJS** philosophy:

```js
const { fromEvent } = rxjs;
const { filter, map } = rxjs.operators;

fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click")
  .pipe(
    filter((click) => click.shiftKey),
    map((event) => ({ x: event.pageX, y: event.pageY }))
  )
  .subscribe((coordinates) =>
    alert(\`Clicked at [${coordinates.x}, ${coordinates.y}]`)
  );
```
Hum. Okay.

That's **a lot of new code**.

Let's dive into it before discussing what advantages this implementation offers over the previous one.

> So... what is this `pipe(...)` method anyway ?

---
## Introducing... Piping!

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

One of the key feature of the **RxJS** library is the ability to **modify, alter, filter, and otherwise transform streams** into other streams.

This is similar to the `|` (pipe) operator in the command line, which allows you to pass the result of a command as input to another command:

```shell
$> `ls` -la . | `grep` txt
```
> Here, the result of the `ls` command is used as the input for the `grep` command

Conveniently, every `Observable` has a method named `pipe(...)`, that can be used to apply a **sequence of operations** on its emitted values.

An operation is nothing more than a function, called `Operator`, that takes an `Observable` as input, does something with its emitted values, and outputs the results in a _new_ `Observable`.

> This output `Observable` will be used as input for the next `Operator` in the sequence, or be subscribed to if it's the last one.

---
### Plumbing 101

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a>]

In our example code, we used a sequence of `Operator`s and applied it on the `Observable` produced by `fromEvent`, using the `pipe(...)` method:

```js
fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click")
  // Call the pipe method on our initial Observable
* .pipe(
    // Apply the filter operator
    `filter`(/* ... */),
    // Then apply the map operator
    `map`(/* ... */)
* )
  // Subscribe to get the final result
  .subscribe(/* ... */);
```
> In this case, the `subscribe(...)` method is called on the `Observable` returned by the `map` operator, not the `fromEvent` function.

It's now time to see what the `filter` and `map` operators do...

---
### `filter` operator

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a>]

For each value emitted by the source `Observable`, this operator checks wether it respects a user-defined condition. The `Observable` returned by `filter` will only emit the values that pass the check.

Here's a marble representation of this operator:

<p class="shadow center"><img src="marbles/filter_operator.svg" width="80%" /></p>

And how you would use it:

```js
randomLetters() // Emits random letters
  .pipe(`filter(letter => letter === 'A')`) // Emits only letters "A"
  .subscribe(letter => console.log(letter)); // "A"
```
> See [the official documentation][rxjs-filter]

---
#### In context

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a> > <a href="#12">`filter` operator</a>]

In our example, we want to filter `click` events based on wether the `Shift` key was pressed.

As a marble diagram, this would look like this:

> `C` stands for "Click (without `Shift` key)", `SC` for "`Shift` + Click"

<p class="shadow center"><img src="marbles/shift_click.svg" width="80%" /></p>

And in the code:

```js
fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click")
  .pipe(`filter(click => click.shiftKey)`)
  .subscribe(click => console.log('Shift key pressed!', click))
```

---
### `map` operator

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a>]

The `map` operator takes each emitted value of the source Observable, apply it a user-defined function, and emits the result of this function.

> This is similar to the `map(...)` method of an `Array`

Here's a marble representation of this operator:

<p class="shadow center"><img src="marbles/map_operator.svg" width="80%" /></p>

And how you would use it:

```js
randomLetters() // Emits randomm letters in upper case
  .pipe(`map(letter => letter.toLowerCase())`) // Emits those letters in lower case
  .subscribe(letter => console.log(letter)); // "a", "b", "c", ...
```
> See [the official documentation][rxjs-map]

---
#### In context

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a> > <a href="#14">`map` operator</a>]

In our example, for each shift-click event, we want a custom object containing only the mouse coordinates.

As a marble diagram, this would look like this:

<p class="shadow center"><img src="marbles/coordinates.svg" width="80%" /></p>

And in the code:

```js
// Emits only click eventy with Shift Key pressed
shiftClick()
  // Emits click coordinates for each shift click
  .pipe(`map(click => ({ x: click.pageX, y: click.pageY }))`)
  // Prints coordinates
  .subscribe(coords => console.log('Received coordinates!', coords))
```
---
### All together now

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a>]

In light of this new knowledge, let's take another look at the complete feature code:

```js
const { fromEvent } = rxjs;
// Operators are accessible through the rxjs.operators object.
*const { filter, map } = rxjs.operators;

fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click")
  .pipe(
*   filter((click) => click.shiftKey),
*   map((event) => ({ x: event.pageX, y: event.pageY }))
  )
  .subscribe((coordinates) =>
    alert(\`Clicked at [${coordinates.x}, ${coordinates.y}]`)
  );
```
> To `import` operators in an ES Module context, you would import them from `rxjs/operators`.

---
#### Marble-ous

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#10">Introducing... Piping!</a> > <a href="#16">All together now</a>]

As a marble diagram, this would look like this:

> User clicks on the button (with or without the `Shift` key)

<p class="shadow center"><img src="marbles/feature.svg" width="90%" /></p>

> Display coordinates in an `alert` using `Obj`

---
## What are the advantages

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

This `pipe` and `Operators` approach has several advantages:

1. The `subscribe` callback **only contains the code for the ultimate operation** we want to execute.
1. The list of operators breaks down in a readable way **which operations are applied and in which order**.
1. You can store the `Observables` produced by each `Operator` in their own variable, to enhance reusability and/or readability:
  ```js
  const `clickObs` = fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click");

  const `shiftClickObs` = `clickObs`.pipe(filter((click) => click.shiftKey));

  const `coordinatesObs` = `shiftClickObs`.pipe(
      map((click) => ({ x: click.pageX, y: click.pageY }))
  );

  `coordinatesObs`.subscribe(
      alert(\`Clicked at [${coordinates.x}, ${coordinates.y}]`)
  );
  ```
1. Since many `Operator`s takes a callback function as parameter, you can easily **refactor your code in small reusable functions**, that could live in their own module _(see next slide)_

### Function refactor

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#18">What are the advantages</a>]

```js
const { fromEvent } = rxjs;
const { filter, map } = rxjs.operators;

fromEvent(document.getElementById("myButton"), "click")
  .pipe(
    filter(`isClickWithShift`),
    map(`extractMouseCoordinates`)
  )
  .subscribe(`displayCoordinates`);

function `isClickWithShift`(click) {
  return click.shiftKey;
}

function `extractMouseCoordinates`(event) {
  return {
    x: event.pageX,
    y: event.pageY
  };
}

function `displayCoordinates`(coordinates) {
  alert(\`Clicked at [${coordinates.x}, ${coordinates.y}]`);
}
```
---
## Parallel Operations

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

`Operator`s that can be used in pipe sequences are called `Pipeable Operator`s. The other kind of `Operator`s are called `Creation Operator`s and are used to create `Observable`s (`fromEvent(...)` is one of them).

Some of those `Operator`s are particularely useful when dealing with parallel asynchronous logic:

- `rxjs.forkJoin(...)` - takes an array (or dictionnary) of `Observable`s, wait for them to complete, then emit an array (or dictionnary) of each `Observable` last emitted value.
  > See [official documentation][rxjs-forkjoin]

- `rxjs.combineLatest(...)` - takes an array of `Observale`s and, each time one of them emits a new value, emits an array of each `Observable` latest emitted value.
  > See [official documentation][rxjs-combinelatest]

---
## Why would I use this... thing?

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a>]

We already discussed the topic of using **callbacks** to handle asynchronous operations, and seen that it could rapidly [get out of hands][callback-hell] when multiple async operations are to be executed one after the other.

So we learnt about **[Promises][js-prom]**, wich mitigates the pains of callbacks and allow setting up more controlled flow of actions.

> But Promises have their limitations and, depending on your needs, they could not be adequates.

Observables (and reactive programming) are **another tool to work with async operations**.

---
### Comparison

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#21">Why would I use this... thing?</a>]

Observables have some **similarities** with [Promises][js-prom], but here's the **key differences**:

| `Promises` | `Observables` |
| --- | --- |
| **Always** asynchronous | **Sometimes** asynchronous |
| Executes **immediately** | Executes **only when subscribe to** |
| Resolve once with one value | Can emit different values periodically until completion |
| - | `Operator`s ! |

---
### Convertion

.breadcrumbs[<a href="#1">RXJS, Reactive programming and Observables</a> > <a href="#21">Why would I use this... thing?</a>]

The RxJS library provides you with utility to convert Promise-based logic to Observable-based logic, and _vice-versa_.

**Promise to Observable**

Use the `from(...)` function to create an `Observable` from a `Promise`:

```js
const promise = Promise.resolve("World");
`from(promise)`.subscribe((name) => console.log(\`Hello ${name}`));
```
> The resulting `Observable` wil emit once, when the underlying `Promise` resolves, then complete.

**Observable to Promise**

Use the `toPromise()` method of an `Observable` to create a `Promise` out of it:

```js
const promise = someObserable$.toPromise();
promise.then(/* ... */);
```
